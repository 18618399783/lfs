# **The Lightweight File System**

The lightweight file system is a distributed file system,is designed to support mass and unstructured file storage.Like many other distributed file system for data integrity,consistency and recovery    ability,scalability,reliability,availability,and cost.But it is also different from other places distributed file system,such as incompatible with public interface,no record file metedata information.Design taking with other distributed file system is not the some strategy,some of the discount choice.
# Feature

 **1. High reliability** 
 
 
	 decentralized design,no single point of failure
	 
	 
**2. High throughput** 

	 asynchronous sequential reading and writing
	 
 **3. Low latency**
 
	 the global load balance
	 
 **4. Horizontal scaling**
